# MonkeySpeciesClassification
Predict Monkey Species

# Content
The dataset consists of two files, training and validation. Each folder contains 10 subforders labeled as n0~n9, each corresponding a species form Wikipedia's monkey cladogram. Images are 400x300 px or larger and JPEG format (almost 1400 images). Images were downloaded with help of the googliser open source code.
Label mapping:
n0, alouattapalliata n1, erythrocebuspatas
n2, cacajaocalvus n3, macacafuscata
n4, cebuellapygmea n5, cebuscapucinus
n6, micoargentatus n7, saimirisciureus
n8, aotusnigriceps n9, trachypithecusjohnii

# Aim
This dataset is intended as a test case for fine-grain classification tasks, perhaps best used in combination with transfer learning. Hopefully someone can help us expand the number of classes or number of images.
